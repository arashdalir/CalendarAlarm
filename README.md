# CalendarAlarm
An android app to read calendar events and create alarm-clock like alarms based on them

This app reads calendar events from the calendar and creates alarms based on them. Unlike the usual notifications, the alarms can/will have the notification sound played in a loop and will be snoozable, just like an alarm.
